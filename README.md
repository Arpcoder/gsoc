# Keploy
Keploy is a no-code testing platform that generates tests from API calls. 

It captures the external dependency network calls (like database queries, internal/external services) for each request to replay them (including writes/mutations!) later during testing. 

Developers can use keploy alongside their favorite unit testing framework to save time writing testcases.
